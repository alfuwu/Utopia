handbook error notes (should be fixed):
page 056 does not mention Influence core tree
page 064, Coup de Grace is misspelled (should be Coup de Grâce)
page 064, Coup de Grâce specialist talent repeats "than" ("...do and the attack deals more damage than than the...")
page 064, Coup de Grâce specialist talent ends with "Otherwise, it deals half as much damage, rounded down, instead." (the ", instead" at the end is unnecessary)
page 064, Dual Wielder specialist talent specifies "multiple weapons" but later specifies "both weapons" rather than "all weapons", making it unclear whether or not it works with more than 2 weapons or not
page 066, Phonetic Composer specialist talent does not state that creatures you teach must share a language (would take a substantially longer amount of time to teach a creature the self-made language if you did not share a common tongue with your student)
